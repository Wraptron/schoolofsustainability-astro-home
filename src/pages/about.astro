          The School of Sustainability at IIT Madras is a hub for interdisciplinary learning and research. We bring together experts, students, and communities to address complex environmental challenges. Our focus lies in integrating technology, policy, and societal perspectives for sustainable solutions. Through education, collaboration, and innovation, we aim to shape responsible future leaders. We believe sustainability is not a subjectâ€”it's a way of thinking, living, and progressing.
