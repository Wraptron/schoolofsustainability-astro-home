              <!-- Description -->
              <p class="font-serif text-base leading-relaxed text-black mb-4">
  With its 2025 edition hosted in the Alps, International Mountain Counference provides
  an excellent opportunity for experts from different disciplines to discuss mountain-related
  issues in a cross-disciplinary setting. The key goals of the conference are to synthesize and
  enhance our understanding of mountain ecosystems that are highly vulnerable to climate change,
  with shifts in biodiversity, ecosystem services, and land use affecting sustainability at local,
  regional, and global scales. As part of Past Global Changes (PAGES) DiverseK Working Group,
  a School of Sustainability member will convene a conference session, "Managing mountain
  ecosystems in a changing climate: integrating long-term data" that is concetualized to explore
  integration of ecological, climatic, and land-use data with local knowledge for the sustainable
  management of mountain regions. The session will address current trends in mountain ecosystems
  including climate impacts on vegetation and forest management, need for incorporating long-term
  ecological and historical land-use data, and evaluation of adaptive policy scenarios with
  stakeholder engagement. More info athttps://imc2025.info/

                As cities grapple with the accelerating impacts of climate
                change, resource scarcity, and socio-economic fragmentation, the
                complex interdependencies between water, food, and waste systems
                demand urgent empirical and policy attention. These domains,
                often siloed in both academic inquiry and urban governance,
                intersect in critical ways – shaping human health, ecological
                resilience, and sustainable urban development. The Cities of
                Care Conference – co-convened by the UofT India Foundation, the
                School of Cities, University of Toronto and the School of
                Sustainability, IIT Madras will be held in Chennai, India, on
                January 30–31, 2026. This convening seeks to deepen
                interdisciplinary research and catalyze dialogue among
                academics, practitioners, and decision-makers to advance
                evidence-based and actionable pathways for more equitable and
                regenerative urban futures. We invite abstracts for original
                research that contribute to theoretical and methodological
                advances and innovative governance strategies for strengthening
                urban systems in the areas of water, food, and/or waste systems.
                Submission Deadline: September 22, 2025 To know more and submit

                Engaging talk on Identity and Beliefs Dissonance by Dr. Aparna
                Anand. She is a lecturer of Economics & Education at Teachers
                College, Columbia University. She works in the fields of
                development economics, and experimental and behavioral
                economics. She is interested in the economics of education in
                developing countries, own child labor substitution, occupational
                identity, and dissonance in beliefs about returns to education.
                In a recent research, she looked at how improved infrastructure
                such as access to piped water affects the empowerment of women
                and their mental health.

                With climate-related risks & associated multi-level esource
                pressures posing a real threat to industry worldwide, bringing
                sustainability into planning & execution is an opportunity for
                growth for industries. Be it value-driven, compliance-driven or
                mandate-driven, there is a growing realization within India's
                corporate sector that value can be created & reinvested through
                facilitating sustainable pathways. However, the notion of a
                trade-off between sustainability & profitability continues,
                necessitating both “top-down” & "bottom-up" reforms in all the
                four pillars of sustainability - Mitigation, Adaptation,
                Recovery, & Innovation. The 6-week Executive Education program
                "Sustainability for Indian Businesses" is designed to help
                industry professionals practically align Sustainable Development
                Goals with core business strategies. By bridging knowledge &
                application gaps, individuals & industries will unlock new
                avenues for growth & contribute towards India’s nationally
                determined contributions & its green, climate-resilient future.

              <p class="font-serif text-base leading-relaxed text-black mb-4">
                The built environment accounts for nearly 40% of global
                greenhouse gas emissions, making sustainable transformation a
                critical priority. The 2-day roundtable, funded by Schmidt
                Sciences, will bring together experts from academia, industry,
                and policy to explore actionable strategies for a more
                sustainable construction and operation practices. The
                discussions will span five thematic sessions: Energy, Design,
                Automation & Digital Technologies, Materials, and Business
                Models & Policy. The event aims to identify and promote scalable
                solutions, address adoption barriers, and outline research
                priorities to accelerate India’s transition toward a low-carbon,
                sustainable built environment.

                of Sustainability IIT Madras, Professor Stratos Pistikopoulos
                FREng (Director, Texas A&M Energy Institute, Dow Chemical Chair,
                University Distinguished Professor, Artie McFerrin Department of
                Chemical Engineering, Texas A&M University, United States) will
                talk about all about sustainable energy transitions. The
                abstract of their talk: Decarbonization, electrification,
                net-carbon neutrality and low-carbon technology constitute
                important drivers in energy transition efforts. Open challenges
                toward such a societal and industrial goal include: (i) how to
                tame the impact of intermittency of many renewable technologies
                and the critical role of energy storage, (ii) the need for
                rigorous life-cycle based carbon accounting, (iii) understanding
                the material transition requirements as an enabler for the
                energy transition, and (iv) managing the costs of the various
                technologies relevant to the transition at different and
                evolving technology readiness levels. Here, we will attempt to
                provide a systematic framework of how to address such challenges
                in a holistic, integrated way toward realistic and sustainable
                energy transition scenarios. We will discuss the salient
                interactions in energy-material-mobility transition, the
                potential opportunities of industrial electrification, carbon
                capture and utilization and the hydrogen economy, and the role
                of policy especially in the context of circular economy. A
                comprehensive multi-scale energy systems engineering approach
                will be presented as the ‘glue’ to navigate and connect the
                various pieces of the puzzle in energy transition."

                The Department of Chemical Engineering and School of
                Sustainability co-hosted a scholarly seminar by Prof. Kazuhiro
                Takanabe from School of Engineering, The University of Tokyo. In
                this seminar, Prof. Takanabe help us delve into discoveries
                concerning non-noble metal electrocatalysts at non-extreme pH,
                specifically focusing on their efficiency in both the oxygen
                evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).
                The resultant cell performance, factoring in the series
                resistance, achieved a 1 A cm−2 at a voltage of approximately
                2.0 V or lower. This achievement stands competitively against
                the top-class commercial alkaline electrolyzers. Finally unique
                dynamic characteristics of electrocatalyst will be discussed
                under mixed buffer conditions, where selective OER was achieved
                in the presence of chloride ions. These findings not only
                highlight the feasibility of non-extreme pH electrochemical
                electrolyzers in industrial applications but also underscore the
                potential for further advancements and optimizations. The
                demonstrated success serves as a compelling indicator of the
                viability of our approach and opens avenues for refining
                non-extreme pH electrolysis for even greater efficiency and
                applicability in industrial settings.

                "Registrations open till November 5, 2024. With climate-related
                risks and associated multi-level resource pressures posing a
                real threat to industry worldwide, bringing sustainability into
                planning and execution is an opportunity of growth for
                industries. Be it value-driven, compliance-driven or
                mandate-driven, there is a growing realization within the
                industrial sector in India that value can be created in
                facilitating sustainable pathways and reinvested towards the
                growth of companies and industry at large. The trade-off between
                sustainability and profitability, however, continues to be a
                hurdle and both “top-down” and “bottom-up” reforms are warranted
                in all the four pillars of sustainability – Mitigation,
                Adaptation, Recovery, and Innovation – and their effectual and
                just implementation to achieve Sustainable Development Goals
                (SDGs). The goal of the program is to familiarize learners with
                the multi-dimensional nature of sustainability in connection
                with its real-world implications. Through communicating the
                existing (and upcoming) toolkit for imagining sustainable
                Industry Landscape in India at the backdrop of India’s changing
                policy frameworks, the course inculcates a systemic view into
                sustainability in tandem with equipping learners to ideate
                practical sustainable scenarios for their respective
                businesses."

                ESG reporting is the disclosure of the impact of a business on
                environmental, social, and corporate governance and a collection
                of factors that can materially affect a business. As ESG
                reporting gains momentum in India, the regulatory framework
                matures. India has a range of ESG challenges, like many other
                developing countries, due to its population size, socioeconomic
                diversity, and aspirations of economic success. Yet, India has
                evolved a lot in the ESG space and is improving rapidly, given
                the strong direction set by the market regulator, the Securities
                and Exchange Board of India (SEBI). Compared with leading
                economies and keeping in line with global trends, India fares
                highly in ESG disclosures and is one of the countries where
                reporting is mandatory instead of voluntary. The central focus
                of this proposed workshop is how we accelerate ESG reporting and
                its challenges. In the previous edition of this workshop held in
                Chennai on 24th May 2024, several challenges were identified by
                industry members representing various sectors, including
                automobiles, fertilizer, cement, finance and manufacturing.
                These include data inconsistencies and measurement accuracies to
                document and report key metrics, the need for ESG knowledge
                across the workforce, including awareness and skilling needs,
                and ensuring fairness across industries and sectors in comparing
                relevant metrics, cost of regulatory compliance as well as cost
                of implementing technologies to achieve net-zero.

                accelerating the growth of the electric vehicles market, where
                the bottleneck is the risk associated with material supply. To
                address this, it has become essential to develop a Circular
                Battery ecosystem through recycling/reusing the spent batteries
                not only to maintain material circularity but also to mitigate
                the environmental impacts. It is important to have discussions
                on the battery management policy, reusing strategies, current
                recycling practices and the challenges to handle tonnes of mixed
                as well as complex composition of battery waste streams. This
                seminar will bring people from various key stakeholder
                industries and researchers from academia together for discussion
                about these issues in the circular economy of battery and

              <p class="font-serif text-base leading-relaxed text-black mb-4">
                With climate change pushing the world towards sustainable and
                clean energy solutions, generating energy from renewable sources
                such as the sun and the wind has come to the forefront. Floating
                Photovoltaics (FPVs) have emerged as a promising option,
                primarily due to the fact that land is becoming increasingly
                scarce and land prices for solar installations are soaring in
                many parts of the world. Despite their potential, the widespread
                adoption of FPVs is fraught with a number of structural,
                environmental, financial and management issues. The FPV
                Roundtable to be held at Indian Institute of Technology Madras
                will be the multi-stakeholder platform to develop the shared
                vision for mainstreaming FPV in India.
